# BG-distribution

BGdist.ZIP contains 5 Windows7 or 10 executables, useful in proton radiotherapy,  plus a folder \BGware that contains working folders for each. 

LOOKUP is a proton desk calculator with built-in help. 

NEU designs hardware (upstream modulator and contoured scatterer) for scattered beams with arbitrary specs. 

LAMINATE uses an existing beam, scatterers and degraders to design a laminated spread-out Bragg Peak (SOBP) to arbitrary specs. 

FitDD fits measured SOBPs, pristine Bragg peaks, or transverse dose distributions using cubic spline or broken spline functions.

BPW fits pristine Bragg peaks with a cubic spline, for use in NEU or LAMINATE or elsewhere.

Install the EXEs and \BGware in any folder (such as your desktop). There are also shortcuts which you can copy to the desktop.
